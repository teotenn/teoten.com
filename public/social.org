Any advice configuring org-social.el with straight.el?

When I try to load the timeline I get the following: =Warning: Could not load org-social-ui module= Then I need to go and load the code in =org-socual-ui.el= and then I can use everything without problem. Any idea why this could be happening?

My config is very simple:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-social
  :straight
  (:host github
   :type git
   :repo "tanrax/org-social.el"
   :branch "main")
  :custom
  (org-social-file "~/Projects/teoten.com/public/social.org")
  (org-social-relay "https://org-social-relay.andros.dev/")
  (org-social-my-public-url "https://teoten.com/social.org"))
#+end_src

Still nothing. I have updated from branch main and I can see the 3 new lines from the commit =51dfaeb= in my local version of the package-install:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Add UI subdirectories to load-path
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "ui" org-social--root-dir))
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "ui/buffers" org-social--root-dir))
#+end_src

But I still keep having the exact same error.

The changes expand properly to the right path ="~/.emacs.d/straight/build/org-social/ui"= and I can see all the right files and directories cloned to ="straight/repos/org-social/"= BUT I cannot see the sub directory =/ui= in the ="straight/build/org-social/"=. I am not sure if this is exactly the issue because I still have the sym link to =org-social-ui.el= file in the build dir (although not compiled), and when I evaluate that file in Emacs I get access to all the UI functionality. So, for now I have changed the value of =org-social--root-dir= to my straight path for repos (=(defconst org-social--root-dir "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/org-social.el/")=) directly in the source code and that solves the problem completely.

Maybe it would be a good idea to make it a =defcustom=? Although it shouldn't be necessary. I don't have experience with packages with sub directories but I use a few so, I can try to find some time during the week to see how they do it and try to solve it the proper way. Meanwhile, I hope all this info is useful. Let me know if you want me to transfer it all to an issue in the repo.

Sorry for the late answer. Sure I'll open the issue

I was having the same question. I am curious what the author [[org-social:https://andros.dev/static/social.org][andros]] has to say.

Personally, I would be good by removing older posts, every 6/12 months. I can imagine how this can create broken links and how some people would like to keep certain things (or all) forever. I have never liked that. I am of the opinion that the old things have to die for the new to come to life. We are already swimming in oceans of data and information anyway so, I would be happy to contribute to cleaning up the mess a little by having total control of my data and my posts. In any other social network I am never sure if my data was completely erased when I click delete.

I was thinking the same. I think it is a flaw in the UI. There are many little things missing or not complete. But it is also a very new package and overall, project. So, it is probably useful to raise an issue in the github repo if you think this is important. Help the project grow.

Tomorrow I complete my first week with my first mechanic keyboard, a Corne V4. I am super happy with it so far. I am still typing quite slow but I like it a lot. Before I was having just normal membrane keyboards but I had enough. I was interested in the Digma Defy, but it is quite expensive so, I decided to try with something more affordable before doing such an investment. Right now I am so happy with the minimalist design of the Corne that I might stay there, but we will see. What I love the most is to have all my modifiers at the reach of my thumbs, it is a game changer.

By the way, I can see the poll wit the proper org - [ ] to C-c C-c mark but of course, one cannot edit somebody else post, nor it would make sense. But I was just wondering if there is an easier way to just "vote" in a poll? You know, rather than writing a post with your answer? But I guess that also makes no sense, right?

I read and saw videos about how many layers you might meed. But all I need is 2 layers: The basic one for the letters and then a 2nd with the numbers, missing symbols and the few F-keys I use regularly. So I am basically using one mod key (tap-hold, yes) for that 2nd layer a bit as a shift key. I have it at the easiest reach of my right thumb. I have Ctrl to the same position of the left thumb. And then space and enter next to each. Alt is the last in my thumb row, t I have it somewhere else because some combinations are complicated there. I guess I still have to tune it. As for Super, it is at the internal 2-key section, where some corne have the little display.

So far I'm happy with that layout and I am very happy with the keyboard, even though I'm still getting used to it.
